                          <p>My name is Jezel E. Ganes I'm 19 years old. I live in Farmington, Tampilisan Zamboanga del Norte.
        I'm a shy but talkative person.My hobbies are singing, dancing, listening to music, reading books and also I'm learning how to do guitar.
        I love my family so much even though we have a financial problem. As of now I am currently a student of JRMSU-Tampilisan Campus taking the course of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
        My life as a student has been an exciting journey for me so far. I have experieced both triumphs and lot of challenges which have helped shape me into a person I am today.
        I'm very thankful because my parent's support me in my journey being a college student even though we have a financial problem.
        As of now I am doing my best in my studies to make my parent's more proud and to make their effort's on me worth it.</p>
